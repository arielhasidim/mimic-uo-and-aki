# Creation of UO and AKI tables

The code above is used to create hourly-adjusted UO tables for each ICU stay in the MIMIC-IV database, as well as to identify the onset and resolution of AKI events. These tables are meant to provide a reliable platform for future research to anyone who wishes to use them. To achieve this objective, it is necessary to run several SQL queries in a particular order. Additionally, we have included a coded workflow in R that can automatically run these queries. 

## Instructions

**We provided a workflow to run all the queries in R** which require [R and Rstudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

Steps:
1. Clone the repo to your local machine
2. Open the `create_data/R workflow/R workflow.Rproj` project
3. In the R session, the `code.R` file should open automatically (if not - open it)
4. Run the commands one-by-one (with <kbd>⌘ Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>⏎ Return</kbd> 
or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>⏎ Enter</kbd>)
    - Pay attention to the instructions in the comments
6. You will be asked to log in to your Google account and state the associated billing account/project name

**NOTE:** Alternativly, all the queries above can be run manually at the BigQuery console consecutively.
